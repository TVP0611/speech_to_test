data_dir/sample_data/672-122797-0000.flac,87109,out in the woods stood a nice little fir tree
data_dir/sample_data/672-122797-0001.flac,308775,the place he had was a very good one the sun shone on him as to fresh air there was enough of that and round him grew many large sized comrades pines as well as firs
data_dir/sample_data/672-122797-0002.flac,266668,he did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air he did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries
data_dir/sample_data/672-122797-0003.flac,91118,but this was what the tree could not bear to hear
data_dir/sample_data/672-122797-0004.flac,190677,in winter when the snow lay glittering on the ground a hare would often come leaping along and jump right over the little tree
data_dir/sample_data/672-122797-0005.flac,63202,oh that made him so angry
data_dir/sample_data/672-122797-0006.flac,260409,to grow and grow to get older and be tall thought the tree that after all is the most delightful thing in the world
data_dir/sample_data/672-122797-0007.flac,122253,in autumn the wood cutters always came and felled some of the largest trees
data_dir/sample_data/672-122797-0008.flac,549257,this happened every year and the young fir tree that had now grown to a very comely size trembled at the sight for the magnificent great trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking the branches were lopped off and the trees looked long and bare they were hardly to be recognised and then they were laid in carts and the horses dragged them out of the wood
data_dir/sample_data/672-122797-0009.flac,60282,have you not met them anywhere
data_dir/sample_data/672-122797-0010.flac,82397,rejoice in thy growth said the sunbeams
data_dir/sample_data/672-122797-0011.flac,58717,and then what happens then
data_dir/sample_data/672-122797-0012.flac,156889,i would fain know if i am destined for so glorious a career cried the tree rejoicing
data_dir/sample_data/672-122797-0013.flac,167480,i am now tall and my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year oh
data_dir/sample_data/672-122797-0014.flac,55684,were i but already on the cart
data_dir/sample_data/672-122797-0015.flac,96894,were i in the warm room with all the splendor and magnificence
data_dir/sample_data/672-122797-0016.flac,180886,yes then something better something still grander will surely follow or wherefore should they thus ornament me
data_dir/sample_data/672-122797-0017.flac,108951,something better something still grander must follow but what
data_dir/sample_data/672-122797-0018.flac,100762,rejoice in our presence said the air and the sunlight
data_dir/sample_data/672-122797-0019.flac,84776,rejoice in thy own fresh youth
