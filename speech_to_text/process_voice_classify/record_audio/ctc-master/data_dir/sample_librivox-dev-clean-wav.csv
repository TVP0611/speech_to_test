data_dir/sample_data/5338-284437-0006.wav,157804,they seem very ignorant poor things said another in reply
data_dir/sample_data/5338-284437-0007.wav,118444,the people must wait outside for there is no room for them in the palace
data_dir/sample_data/5338-284437-0008.wav,296044,so they followed her through the low archway and in a room beyond very simply furnished sat a young girl engaged in darning a pair of pink stockings
data_dir/sample_data/5338-284437-0009.wav,329484,she was a beautiful girl of about seventeen years of age not fat like all the rest of the pinkies but slender and well formed according to our own ideas of beauty
data_dir/sample_data/5338-284437-0010.wav,212044,her complexion was not a decided pink but a soft rosy tint not much deeper than that of trot's skin
data_dir/sample_data/5338-284437-0011.wav,99404,what is it coralie she asked the woman
data_dir/sample_data/5338-284437-0012.wav,96844,the queen gazed upon our friends with evident interest
data_dir/sample_data/5338-284437-0013.wav,360044,she smiled a little sadly at trot seemed to approve button bright's open frank face and was quite surprised because cap'n bill was so much bigger than her own people
data_dir/sample_data/5338-284437-0015.wav,170604,perhaps you are trying to ridicule me she continued regarding the sailor's face closely
data_dir/sample_data/5338-284437-0016.wav,107884,there is nothing majestic about me as you know very well
data_dir/sample_data/5338-284437-0017.wav,160364,coralie do you consider majesty a proper word to use when addressing a queen

data_dir/sample_data/5338-284437-0019.wav,99724,but surely that is all wrong said tourmaline gravely
data_dir/sample_data/5338-284437-0020.wav,341644,therefore i am a mere agent to direct the laws which are the will of the people and am only a public servant obliged constantly to guard the welfare of my subjects
data_dir/sample_data/5338-284437-0021.wav,240524,in that case said button bright you're entitled to the best there is to pay for your trouble
data_dir/sample_data/5338-284437-0022.wav,322604,if i lived as luxuriously as my people do and had servants and costly gowns the good pinkies would say that their queen had more than they themselves and it would be true
